Once you have downloaded the dataset, clone this github repository and make sure you have the folders:-
1. Code - Python scripts
2. Excel - Dataset description and class distribution

5. multi
6. ship
7. water

Once your project structure is ready, use the below command for running the script:-

> cd Code/
> 
> python3 train.py --model {model-name}
<br>
Replace model-name with "VGG16", "VGG19", "Inception", "Resnet", "Xception", "CNN-KNN" to use the train script. The environment in which the code is running
should have the following packages installed:- <br>
1. tensorflow == 2.11.0 <br>
2. keras == 2.11.0 <br>
3. sklearn == 1.2.0 <br>
