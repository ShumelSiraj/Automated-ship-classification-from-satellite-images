The results presented are from a pre-trained machine learning model.

*The model is trained on image data with a size of 100 pixels and three color channels (RGB).

*It is trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.001.

*The model is designed for supervised learning to classify images into one of seven possible classes.

*The classification_report function from sklearn.metrics library is used to evaluate the model's performance.

*The classification_report provides a detailed report of various metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, for each class.

*The high scores obtained for each class in the classification_report demonstrate the model's effectiveness in classifying images accurately and efficiently.
